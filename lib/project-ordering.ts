// repo via resolveProject), so worktree sessions group under their project.
//
// The project list is ordered by when each project was added (addedAt desc =
// most recently added first), NOT by session activity: activity changes on
// every session refresh (agent runs, message edits, unread transitions) and
// would make project rows jump around constantly. Registration order is
// stable — it only changes when the user explicitly adds a project.
// Session-discovered projects (no addedAt) follow the registered ones in
// path order, which is also stable.
