# Contributing to Cody

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Setup

- Node.js 22.19.0 or newer
- The [omp](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) binary on your `PATH` (or set `CODY_OMP_BIN`)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # http://127.0.0.1:30178
```

## Checks (must pass before submitting)

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                                   # type check
npm run lint                                       # ESLint, zero warnings
npm test                                           # unit tests
```

Avoid `npm run build` during local development — it writes to `.next/` and
interferes with the dev server. Builds are for release work.

## Conventions

- **Styling**: use the design tokens in `app/globals.css` (colors, radius,
  shadow, motion) — no hardcoded colors. Shared primitives live in
  `components/ui/` (Dialog/Tooltip/Collapsible/field/toast, built on Base UI);
  icons come from `lucide-react`.
- **i18n**: every user-facing string needs entries in all three dictionaries:
  `lib/i18n/locales/{en,zh-CN,ja}.json`.
- **Architecture**: Cody never imports `@oh-my-pi/*` or `@earendil-works/*`
  packages (Bun-only). Live agent features go through the `omp` child process
  via RPC; see `DESIGN.md` and `AGENTS.md` for the full contract.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused; describe the user-visible change and how you verified it.
- For UI changes, include before/after screenshots in both light and dark
  themes when practical.

## Reporting issues

Please use the issue templates and include your OS, Node version, omp version,
and browser.
